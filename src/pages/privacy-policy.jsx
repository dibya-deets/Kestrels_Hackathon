            <h2 className="font-pixel text-xl md:text-2xl mt-8 mb-3">5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>InvesTerra only processes personal data where we have a lawful basis under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). These lawful bases include: your consent, the performance of a contract, compliance with legal obligations, or processing under legitimate interests, provided your rights and freedoms are not infringed. 5.1 Account Creation and User Management We only collect personal data that is strictly necessary for the delivery of our services, and we ensure that our systems are designed to limit data use to the minimum required for functionality, learning progress, and personalization. We use your identity, contact, and profile information to register your account, authenticate your access, and manage your profile. This allows us to provide secure, consistent access to the Platform and related features. The lawful basis for this processing is the performance of a contract. 5.2 Educational Services and Progress Tracking Your usage data, module completions, and feedback are processed to track your learning progress, award certificates, and personalise lesson recommendations. We also retain completion records, badges earned, and quiz performance for educational reporting. This processing is necessary for contract fulfilment and supported by our legitimate interest in improving educational outcomes. 5.3 AI Personalisation and Intelligent Tutoring When you engage with our AI-powered tutors, we collect data on questions asked, content reviewed, and progress patterns. This allows our systems to suggest tailored content and identify learning gaps. While this processing is based on our legitimate interest in providing dynamic support, you may be asked to give explicit consent for certain forms of AI-driven personalisation involving profiling. 5.4 Child User Support and Age-Appropriate Design For users under the age of 13, we process date of birth, guardian contact details, and limited profile data. We collect verifiable parental consent before any child data is activated on our systems. In accordance with the UK’s Children’s Code, we apply strict data minimisation, disable behavioural tracking by default, and ensure content and interactions are appropriate for younger audiences. The lawful basis here is both legal obligation and consent. 5.5 Subscription Management and Payment Processing If you subscribe to our services, we will process your billing details, subscription plan, and payment status using secure third-party processors. We retain these records for tax, fraud, and financial audit purposes. Processing is necessary to fulfil our contract with you and to comply with UK financial regulations. 5.6 Communications and Customer Support We process your contact details and enquiry history to handle support requests, respond to feedback, and ensure platform reliability. These interactions help us improve service quality and user satisfaction. This processing is based on our legitimate interest in maintaining professional and responsive communication channels. 5.7 Gamification, Competitions, and Incentives When you participate in leaderboards, achievement unlocks, or promotional events, we process your gamification activity to calculate eligibility, track scores, and issue rewards. This enhances user engagement and motivation. We rely on legitimate interest to support this functionality, though consent may be requested for prize-based competitions or marketing-linked incentives. If our platform uses automated decision-making or profiling that produces significant effects (e.g., content gating, certification unlocks), you have the right to request human intervention, express your point of view, and challenge any such decisions in accordance with Article 22 of the UK GDPR. 5.8 Platform Security and Abuse Prevention We collect technical and device data—such as IP addresses, session behaviour, and login patterns—to detect fraudulent behaviour, monitor misuse, and protect the integrity of our platform. This includes tools that flag suspicious activity and enforce automated bans. The lawful basis here is both legal obligation and our legitimate interest in maintaining a secure environment. 5.9 Product Improvement and Analytics Aggregated usage data, content interaction patterns, and technical performance logs are used to improve the design and effectiveness of our platform. We assess which features are underused, where learners drop off, and how different modules perform. This processing is grounded in our legitimate interest to innovate and optimise the learning experience. 5.10 Transactional and Service Notifications We may use your email or contact data to send non-promotional communications such as account confirmations, subscription reminders, payment receipts, or urgent platform notices. This communication is necessary to fulfil our contract with you. 5.11 Marketing and Promotional Messages If you opt-in, we may send you updates about new features, subscription offers, and curated content recommendations. You can withdraw consent for marketing at any time through your settings or by contacting us. Marketing activities are strictly consent-based and in compliance with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). 5.12 Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Use We may process personal data to meet legal requirements under UK law, such as fraud detection, tax reporting, safeguarding policies, or responding to law enforcement requests. In such cases, processing is carried out on the basis of legal obligation. 5.13 Anonymised Data for Research and Statistics Where possible, we anonymise your personal data so that it cannot be used to identify you. Such data may be used for internal research, analytics, or reporting. Anonymised data is no longer considered personal data under the UK GDPR and does not require a lawful basis. 5.14 Changes to Purpose or Legal BasisIf we intend to use your personal data for a new purpose not originally described in this Privacy Policy, we will notify you in advance and explain the new legal basis for processing. If required, we will request your explicit consent before proceeding.</p>
            <h2 className="font-pixel text-xl md:text-2xl mt-8 mb-3">6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>InvesTerra recognises the importance of safeguarding children’s personal data and complies with all applicable UK legislation and guidance concerning underage users. We take particular care when collecting or processing any information relating to a child. 6.1 Who Is Considered a Child For the purposes of this Privacy Policy and in alignment with the UK GDPR, a "child" is any user under the age of 13. This age threshold is consistent with Article 8 of the UK GDPR and the UK’s Age-Appropriate Design Code (Children’s Code), as enforced by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Users aged 13 to 17 are also provided with enhanced protections and user-friendly privacy settings, but parental consent is not legally required for this age group. This age threshold is consistent with Article 8 of the UK GDPR and the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code (Children’s Code), issued under the Data Protection Act 2018 and enforced by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). 6.2 Verifiable Parental Consent If a child wishes to register for an account on the InvesTerra platform, we will request verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian before any personal information is collected or stored. This consent process may include: A consent link sent via email to the parent/guardian Confirmation via digital signature or account authentication The option to manage or revoke child access at any time We use reasonable and proportionate methods to verify that the person providing consent holds parental responsibility in accordance with UK data protection standards. If parental consent is not granted, the child’s account will remain inactive, and no personal data will be retained beyond what is required to manage the consent workflow. Our platform features child-friendly explanations, simplified terms, and transparent privacy prompts to help younger users understand what data is collected and why. We do not use misleading design elements to pressure children into making privacy-affective choices. 6.3 Information Collected from Children When parental consent is obtained, we may collect: First name or pseudonym Date of birth or age confirmation Progress within educational modules Gamification activity (points, badges, achievements) Questions asked to AI tutors Interaction timestamps and activity logs We do not collect location data, contact information, or behavioural advertising data from users under 13. Written answers, reflections, and interactions submitted by children to our educational modules or AI tutor are stored solely for learning progression purposes. These inputs are not shared publicly or used for non-educational profiling. All personal data collected from children is used exclusively to support their educational development and ensure a safe, functional learning experience. It is never used for targeted advertising, third-party sharing, or commercial profiling. 6.4 Data Minimisation and Restricted Tracking In line with the ICO’s Children’s Code, we limit the scope of data collected from children to what is strictly necessary for educational functionality. We do not: Profile children for marketing purposes Use dark patterns to encourage prolonged use Enable behavioural analytics unless anonymised and aggregated By default, all AI suggestions, in-platform feedback, and learning nudges are contextual and educational only, without relying on behavioural profiling or persistent identifiers in relation to users under 13. 6.5 Parental Rights and Controls Parents or guardians may: Review the data their child has shared Request correction or deletion of the child’s data Revoke previously granted consent at any time Limit platform features such as gamification or AI suggestions These controls are accessible via the parent’s linked account or by submitting a request to our Data Protection Officer (DPO). We retain children’s personal data only as long as necessary to provide the educational services, comply with legal obligations, or respond to consent changes. Where accounts are inactive or parental consent is withdrawn, personal data will be permanently deleted within 30 days unless otherwise required by law. 6.6 Enforcement and Breach Notification If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without the appropriate consent, we will take immediate steps to delete the data and disable the account. In the event of a data breach affecting a child’s account, we will notify the affected family and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) as required by law. 6.7 Safeguarding and Duty of Care InvesTerra is committed to upholding the highest standards of safeguarding and digital wellbeing, especially where children or vulnerable users interact with our platform. While we are not a school or formal educational institution, we voluntarily apply duty-of-care principles aligned with UK safeguarding expectations and the Children’s Code (2021) issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). We actively monitor for patterns or behaviours that may indicate misuse, inappropriate conduct, or emotional distress within our learning tools, AI tutor interactions, or discussion features (where applicable). In such cases, we may intervene through technical restrictions, internal flagging mechanisms, or, in serious cases, human review. If a safeguarding risk becomes evident, and the situation presents a genuine concern for a child's welfare or safety, InvesTerra may consult relevant legal, educational, or safeguarding professionals in accordance with its internal escalation policy and applicable laws. We take these decisions seriously and handle them in strict confidence. Our internal moderators, staff, and contractors undergo basic safeguarding training to help them understand and escalate concerns responsibly. We also provide reporting channels for parents, guardians, or educators to raise concerns directly to our compliance team. Where InvesTerra services are embedded within schools or delivered in partnership with educational institutions, we are committed to aligning our platform’s data handling, design standards, and escalation processes with the school’s existing safeguarding and parental notification policies. InvesTerra believes that digital education should never compromise child safety, emotional health, or autonomy. We therefore embed privacy-by-design, transparent communication, and proportional data use into every feature offered to children or young learners.</p>
            <h2 className="font-pixel text-xl md:text-2xl mt-8 mb-3">7. Automated Decision-Making and AI Systems</h2>
            <p>InvesTerra incorporates artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies to enhance the learning experience, optimise personalised content, and assist users in navigating financial education modules. Our AI features are designed to operate ethically, transparently, and in full compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the UK’s AI Safety Principles (2023), and the ICO’s guidance on profiling and automated decision-making. 7.1 Purpose of AI Use We use AI to support the following platform functions: Recommending educational modules or difficulty tiers based on user performance. Providing contextual tips, reminders, and learning nudges. Delivering tailored quizzes and simulated case studies. Summarising prior progress or gaps in knowledge. Generating adaptive feedback during simulations or gamified learning activities. All AI decisions are educational in nature and do not produce legal, financial, or similarly significant effects. They are used only to personalise your learning experience and progress feedback. 7.2 Types of Data Used in AI Systems The following categories of personal data may be processed by our AI tools: Performance data: quiz scores, module completion, time spent, retry frequency. Account data: user age group, declared interests, preferred learning style. Interaction data: AI prompts, questions asked, tutor follow-ups. Gamification data: badges, progress streaks, and certificate status. This data is not used to infer sensitive personal characteristics (e.g., mental health, beliefs, financial condition), nor is it shared externally for profiling purposes. 7.3 Human Oversight and Limitations We do not engage in fully automated decision-making that has legal or similarly significant effects, as defined under Article 22 of the UK GDPR. All AI-based outputs on our platform: Are subject to human oversight and can be overridden manually. Serve as assistive features, not enforcers of fixed user paths. Do not result in binding decisions about certification, content locking, or billing. If a user believes an AI-driven recommendation or outcome is incorrect, they may request a manual review or content reset through privacysupport@investerra.com. 7.4 Right to Opt Out or Request Explanation Under the UK GDPR: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where that decision produces legal or significant effects. You have the right to request human intervention, express your point of view, and contest the decision. We respect this right and provide users with: The ability to disable AI-driven content recommendations via account settings. The option to review AI-based learning feedback manually. If a user under 18 is involved, parental control settings may also govern the use or restriction of AI features for that account. 7.5 AI Fairness, Explainability, and Compliance We adhere to the UK government's Pro-Innovation Approach to AI Regulation (2023) and align with the ICO’s AI Auditing Framework, including: Performing regular fairness assessments on learning outputs. Minimising the risk of discriminatory or biased outcomes. Avoiding reinforcement loops that disadvantage learners based on earlier errors. Maintaining clear documentation of algorithmic logic and data sources. Where feasible, we provide explainable AI logic in natural language so that learners (especially minors) can understand how suggestions were derived. 7.6 No Use of Biometric or Emotion-Based Profiling InvesTerra does not collect or process: Voice data Webcam input Typing speed Sentiment analysis Biometric or neurofeedback data We believe such techniques are intrusive and disproportionate for educational settings, especially involving children. 7.7 AI and Children’s Rights In line with the Children’s Code: All AI features for users under 13 are simplified, explainable, and educational in scope. AI tools are turned off or minimised unless parental consent is given. Profiling or prediction features are never used to limit access or manipulate engagement by underage users.</p>
